![amazon_logo _CB633269640_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83352965/209563633-bbd91bf1-3c7f-4c95-9249-da0e84b1dec2.png)
# Business Problem

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is accurately calculating the ratings given to products after the sale. Solving this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce website, highlighting the product for the seller, and providing a hassle-free shopping experience for the buyer. Another problem is correctly sorting the reviews given for products. Misleading reviews that stand out can directly affect the sales of the product, causing both financial loss and customer loss. Solving these two fundamental problems will increase sales for the e-commerce website and sellers while allowing customers to complete their shopping journey smoothly.
